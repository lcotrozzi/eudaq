### First steps

Please check out the online documentation at 
- http://eudaq.github.io/ or 
- https://telescopes.desy.de/EUDAQ or
- the manual, see below

### Other sources of documentation

The user's manual is provided as LaTeX source files in the repository;
to generate the pdf on Linux/OSX, make sure that you have installed ImageMagick, then follow these steps:
```
cd build
cmake -DEUDAQ_BUILD_MANUAL=ON ..
make pdf
```
The manual can then be found in ```./doc/manual/EUDAQUserManual.pdf```.

To generate the doxygen documentation, make sure that you have installed doxygen and run
```
make doxygen
```
in the ```build``` directory after CMake. The resulting HTML files are stored in ```../doc/doxygen/html```.

1. Prerequisites for installation
---------------------------------

1.1. Main Library, Executables and GUI
--------------------------------------
EUDAQ requires a C++11 compliant compiler and a Qt version 5 or higher to build GUIs.

### Linux
------------------
#### gcc
Version (```gcc --version```): We recommend version 4.9 or later:
``` 
sudo apt-get install gcc-4.9-multilib
```
Setting environment variables:
``` 
export CXX=/usr/bin/g++-4.9
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.9
```
Setting gcc version (symlink):
http://askubuntu.com/questions/26498/choose-gcc-and-g-version


#### Qt 
Install Qt5 or later, e.g. by using the package manager of your distribution: ```apt-get install qt5-devel```


### Windows
------------------
#### MSVC
- The recommende windows compiler is MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++) like Visual Studio 2013 and later
- Download Visual Studio Express Desktop (e.g. 2013 Version): http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40787

### OS X
------------------
#### Clang
Clang (at least version 3.1)
#### Qt
Install Qt5 or later, e.g. by using MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/): ```sudo port install qt5-mac-devel```

2. Configuring and installation/compiling EUDAQ
----------------------------------

cmake will configure the installation and prepare the makefiles. It searches for all the required files. It has to be executed in the ```build``` folder, however the relevant CMakeLists.txt is in the main level, thus, the command is ```cmake ..```. If cmake is successful, EUDAQ can be installed. Variables set are cached in CMakeCache.txt and will again be taken into account at the next cmake run.

cmake has several options to activate or deactivate programs which will be built. The main library (libeuaq_core.so) is always built, while the rest of the package is optional. Defaults are to build the main executables and
(if Qt is found) the GUI application. Disable this behavior by setting
e.g. ```-DEUDAQ_BUILD_GUI=OFF``` (disabling GUI executables) or enable
e.g. producers using ```-DEUDAQ_LIBRARY_BUILD_LCIO=ON``` to enable setting up the
configuration and compilation environment of LCIO extenstion support and
executables. More options:
https://telescopes.desy.de/EUDAQ#Cmake_options

If cmake is not successful and complains about something is missing, it is recommended to clean the ```build``` folder, before a new try, e.g. .

If problems occur during installation, please have a look in the issues, if a similiar problem already occured. If not, feel free to create a new ticket: https://github.com/eudaq/eudaq/issues

### Linux/OSX:

Configuring:
```
cd build
cmake ..
```
Installing:
```
make install
```
Cleaning:
```
rm -rf *
```

### Windows

Start the Visual Studio "Developer Command Prompt" from the Start Menu entries for Visual Studio (Tools subfolder) which opens a ```cmd.exe``` session with the necessary environment variables already set. If your Qt installation path has not been added to the global %PATH% variable, you need to execute the "qtenv2.bat" batch file in the Qt folder, e.g.
```
C:\Qt\Qt5.1.1\5.1.1\msvc2013\bin\qtenv2.bat
```
(Replace "5.1.1" with the version string of your Qt installation.)

Go to the EUDAQ folder and configure:
```
cd c:\[...]\eudaq\build
cmake ..
```
(This generates the VS project files.)

Installing into eudaq\bin:
```
cmake --build . --target install --config Release
```

This will compile the main library and the GUI; for the remaining processors, please check the individual documentation.
